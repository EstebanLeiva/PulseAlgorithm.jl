PulseAlgorithm.jl provides an implementation for the Pulse Algorithm for Reliable Shortest Path Problems (PA-RSPPs) designed to tackle challenging stochastic shortest path problems in networks with normally distributed link travel times with correlation. This algorithm scales efficiently in large networks and performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. This package is designed for researchers and practitioners in transportation engineering, logistics, and telecommunications in which these types of networks may arise.
